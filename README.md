# Tic_Tac_Toe_AI

This is a Tic Tac Toe game designed based on Minimax algorithm

Its a simple html file that has javascript doing all the work.

Minmax algorithm here uses an evalulation function that provides score based on the board.
If its 'X's turn then program chooses the highest score. Opposite to it if its 'O's turn then it chooses lowest score.

Based on this scoring it makes the choice.

This particular version only looks at one step in future and makes it decisions. Hence its possible to beat AI in certain moves.

This code can be modified to look for 2 steps in future and in that case it wont be possible to beat AI in this game. Hopefully I will come up with 2 ply version soon.
